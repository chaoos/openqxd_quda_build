# TODO

## Gauge field indexing

- [x] All reordering of gauge field in reorder_openqcd_to_quda() in quda_utils.c
- [x] Only have generic lexicographical ordering in OpenQCDOrder in gauge_field_order.h

## Spinor field indexing

- [x] All reordering of spinor field in reorder_spinor_openqcd_to_quda() in quda_utils.c
- [x] Generic load() and save() in color_spinor_field_order.h (in the same way as in OpenQCDOrder in gauge_field_order.h)
- [x] Check norm_square of a random spinor
- [ ] Calculate and compare <psi| gamma |psi>
- [ ] Wilso-Dirac operator without Clover-term using unit gauge field

## Misc

- [x] Add input file to repo
